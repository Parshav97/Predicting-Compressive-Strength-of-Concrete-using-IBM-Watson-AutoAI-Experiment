# Predicting-Compressive-Strength-of-Concrete-using-IBM-Watson-AutoAI-Experiment
Project Description:

Concrete is a material used in construction that has great versatility and which is used across
the globe. Concrete has several advantages, including good compressive strength, durability,
work ability, construction availability, and low cost. Determining accurate concrete strength is
a major civil engineering problem. Test results of 28- day concrete cylinder represent the
characteristic strength of the concrete that has been prepared and cast to form the concrete work.
It is important to wait 28 days to ensure the quality control of the process, although it is very
time consuming. Machine learning techniques are progressively used to simulate the characteristic
of concrete materials and have developed into an important research area. This study proposed a
comprehensive study using an advanced machine learning technique to predict the compressive
strength of concrete from early age test results.

Solution:
An ability to predict the compressive strength of concrete early allows constructors to quickly understand the concreteâ€™s probable weaknesses and make a decision to manage a destruction process or continue with construction. Further, to the benefit of both user (and purchaser) and producer, reliably and rapidly predicting the results of a 28-day test would benefit all stakeholders as opposed to waiting the full, conventional, 28 days.
We are building a Machine Learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete using IBM Watson AutoAI Machine Learning Service. The model is deployed on IBM cloud to get scoring end point which can be used as API in mobile app or web app building. We are developing a web application which is built using node red service. We make use of the scoring end point to give user input values to the deployed model. The model prediction is then showcased on User Interface.
